# Hot carrier cooling

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org) outlining theory and calculations for hot polaron cooling in halide perovskites including CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and CsPbI<sub>3</sub>.

Static renders of the notebooks are available here, but simply download the repository and open using `jupyter notebook` for interactive versions.
